\chapter{Data structure, features and hidden states}


Previous connection
- Follow up statements about data in cybersecurity, follow prevous chapter with choosing relevant parts of logs
Way through this chapter
TODO
Next connection
- Chosen data will be used for further experiments



reference json grinder and its usage to process data

reference some source that is talking about data in cyber security, resp. on theory part

- What kind of data we have - mention all parts of cuckoo log, mention even virus total reports
- (theory for basic statistcs, but maybe not)
- GOALS
  - data processing, pruning and so on
  - Analyze captured data. Report basic statistics and choose appropriate features and hidden states for further modelling
- dataset structure
  - Bias in practical data like this - security data, what are the influences
  - Balanced dataset - in term of accuracy metric performance
  - What each part means (including signatures)
- basic statistics - histogram...
- On Hmill usage - features, hidden states (Section for each, description)
- Signatures - hidden states
- Features  desription
- Maybe try to extract more candidates (But I would have to perform several more experiments, but data pruning should not be problem)
  - I tried to choose enhanced and summary part but it was too much and enhanced part contains bias like timestamp and so on, so I decided to choose only summary part and later only segments from it, using whole summary lead us to really slow convergence...I think
