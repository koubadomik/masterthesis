\chapter{Conclusions} \label{chap:concl}
 We went from one physical machine with Linux on it to dataset and model and it explanation, which was the goal of this thesis. The thesis is quite wide and not aiming at particular part of the process...
% Discuss results and evaluate goals.

% - goals and their achivement, results, outputs
% - future work
%     - larger dataset
%     - we did something like proof of concept, we need more data and robust modelling
%     - explaining issues (maybe ask Pevny what they are trying now)
% - thanks to


The performance of presented models is really good regarding the measures which we presented. \emph{Hmill} should be examined under different conditions just to see the conditions under which the model is not performing well. This should lead to better understanding of generalization and even explanation. \emph{Hmill} should be very important in cyber security application due to the fact that it is able to operate \emph{JSON} files which are quite usual format of data it not totally unstructured. Based on our experiments we draw the conclusion that explanation is very important for future work because models is created for the actual data and it is very complex to observe particular models and believe very good precision which it is performing with.

future work should aim to better explanation (maybe not per sample) and also on clustering and pruning methods to avoid the randomness in explanation result
