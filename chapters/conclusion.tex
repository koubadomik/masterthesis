\chapter{Conclusions}

We went from one physical machine with Linux on it to dataset and model and it explanation, which was the goal of this thesis. The thesis is quite wide and not aiming at particular part of the process...

Discuss results and evaluate goals.

- goals and their achivement, results, outputs
- future work
    - larger dataset
    - we did something like proof of concept, we need more data and robust modelling
    - explaining issues (maybe ask Pevny what they are trying now)
- thanks to
