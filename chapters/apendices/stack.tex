\chapter{Used technology stack} \label{app:technologies}
Our technology stack is quite broad, in lists below we divide technologies into two groups based on what we did use it for. We do not mention standard linux tools like \emph{shell scripts}, \emph{ssh} etc. The main part of our experimenting we spent working on Ubuntu 20.04 (\url{https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/}).

In the process we usualy worked with a lot of tools we mention only those which had significant impact in our work.


In each case, what we it is, link, what we used it for

\section*{Sandboxing and infrastructure}
  \section*{Capev2 with community signatures}
  \section*{KVM with https://github.com/doomedraven/Tools/blob/master/Virtualization/kvm-qemu.sh}
  \section*{Ansible}
  \section*{Windows 7 machines}
  \section*{Networking tools - openSSH, brctl, Ubuntu Server, virtualbox, syslog, ufw, fail2toban (everything from Sebas)}
  \section*{Python3}
  \section*{Others}


\section*{Data and machine learning}
\subsection*{Julia}
Describe Julia
Used libraries table with version and short description
Jupyter marginally
\subsection*{Computing grid system}



  %-----------------------------------------
% Technology - Julia (I think I should add this in some appendix, summarize it and reference all sources used)
%   - describe why and basic features and advantages and cons
%   - Also all different codes, documented, refactored list even important libraries used in Julia

% JsonGrinder (even a little bit describe function)
% \emph{EvalMetrics.jl}

% Divide it in parts according to what we did with the infrastructure

  % Used technologies (in appendix)
%   - previous
%   - ExplainMill
%   (reference all the repositories - even cuckoo comminity)

% \todo{among appendices technologie add even (Technical background, used metascenter archicture...) and even the script
% - used technologies - add to appendix as in previous chapter
%   - \todo{reference JsonGrinder, Mill, EvalMetrics...}
%   - reference, describe functioning
