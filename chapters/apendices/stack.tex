\chapter{Technology} \label{app:technologies}
Our technology stack is quite broad, in the lists below, we divide the tools into two groups based on what we did use it for. We do not mention standard Linux tools like \emph{shell scripts}, \emph{ssh} etc. We mention only those which had a significant impact on our work.


\section*{Sandboxing and infrastructure}
\subsection*{Capev2 with community signatures}
There are several relevant sources, here are the most important:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item Public instance --- https://capesandbox.com/
  \item Opensource project ---  https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2 (under GNU General Public License v3.0)
  \item Community extensions --- https://github.com/kevoreilly/community
  \item Documentation --- https://capev2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Virtualization}
Virtualization of sandbox machines, router machine, and other related stuff was ensured by the following tools:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item \emph{Kernel-based Virtual Machine} --- https://www.linux-kvm.org
  \item \emph{VirtualBox} --- https://www.virtualbox.org/
  \item \emph{Windows 7} --- operating system running on sandbox virtual machines
  \item \emph{Ubuntu server} --- operating system running on VPN lab edge router
  \item Other tools and sources --- https://github.com/doomedraven
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Networking}
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item Ansible --- https://www.ansible.com/
  \item OpenVPN --- https://openvpn.net/
  \item brctl --- https://linux.die.net/man/8/brctl
  \item rsyslog --- https://www.rsyslog.com/
  \item fail2ban --- https://www.fail2ban.org/
  \item aide --- https://aide.github.io/
  \item ufw --- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Programming}
For programming tasks in the infrastructure part we used \emph{Python 3} (see in \ref{app:attach}).
\subsection*{Others}
We are really pleased that we could use \emph{pafish} (https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish) as a testing malware sample, we used it many times.

\section*{Data and machine learning}
\subsection*{Julia}
For programming tasks in this part we used \emph{Julia} language --- https://julialang.org/. Julia has many advantages regarding maily performance compared to Python which could be considered as alternative. But we do not aspire to advocate this language, programming environment was mainly determined by the \emph{HMill} framework which is implemented in this language by \cite{Mandlik2020}. List of the most important used libraries and their versions:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item \emph{JsonGrinder.jl} --- \cite{Pevny2019} (v2.1.4)
  \item \emph{Mill.jl} --- \cite{Pevny2018} (v2.4.1)
  \item \emph{Flux.jl} --- \cite{Innes2018a, Innes2018} (v0.11.6)
  \item \emph{EvalMetrics.jl} --- https://github.com/VaclavMacha/EvalMetrics.jL (v0.2.1)
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Computing grid system}
For resource-demanding computation we used CESNET metacenter (mentioned in acknowledgements) --- https://www.metacentrum.cz/en/Sluzby/Grid/index.html.
