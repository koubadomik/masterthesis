%NICE TO HAVE
%COMPATE SIGNATURES DATA PART WITH THE EXPLANATION
% Would it be better with more samples? (some mathematical magic?)
  %%---------------------
  
% discussion, why we are doing that - I think we can somehow see, what the original signature should care about - what else is significant from the behavior log, but we can see in general other malicious patterns - regardless original signature goal, obviously we see something else which is common
% reason why we want to look at it, about the main question - are we able to learn more than the sandbox is doing deterministically so far?
  % Connect to motivation part of this chapter
  % Do not be black and white, try to formulate hypothesis which should be derived, do not state truth
  % Add some philozophiing... (about the risky things, assumptions, reference explanation theory chapter)
  % Based on \todo{chapter about explanation theory}, mention specific setup (confidence level, pruning method...), configuration and pseudocode of the explainer (all steps, extract only positive...) (we derived it from Pevny's paper, we did not experiment with another setups), reference code in attachement
  % What we did with output more (aggregation of results), how many explanations we have, (two rounds)

  % Motivation about mention Thorsten's advice to look at implementation of python signatures and 
%   hopefully discussion on if the parts contains something significant according to type of signature and so on, or we can find something else than only the deterministic base which the signatue implementation is checking


%   Compare the results to Pevny's Explaner results

%   take signature groups and compare their code to explanation, from each signature type (rest get to the Appendix)
%   report explanation and even some information from logs!!
%   - Time to explain, Explanation size for different types of signatures, input size (Pevny is addressing those)


% Results for each signature (present both attempts)
% performance context and what is the strenght of the explanation (is it relevant)
% What it does (implementation) and if we can see it in explanation
% top of histogram.
% hypothesis we can formulate

% Final thoughts, what categories we can see based on results and what are main problems, compare the explanation of initial two groups of signatures and even try to say something about different subject groups
% we are able to explain and this part should be further researched - describe particular problems including the type of explaning for this model complexity.
% We are experiencing two challenges which were mentioned earlier and those are - huge entrophy (take an example path to file for example) leads to big entrophy of explanation and we do not have some special method to determine similarities (some norm or...) (above our scope), confounding variables which we are not able to identify.
% It would be interesting to thing about the second approach - trasparency, to extract explanation for model not for sample, it is really hard to generalize such conslusions
% I think we can even state that the principle is working and we are able to identify why the model is predicting some things, cons of it is the example based explanation, better could be some kind of dataset based explanation

% - Admit failures on bias variables
%   â—‹ 

  

% it is not problem to report that result is not easily interpretable and in practise we would have to create way of extracting general knowledge from sample explanations)

% Explanation as another random variable




%   Describe steps - how many samples we have and how we choose them, how we just draw histogram results and try some reasoning
%   - Goal 
% - identify the artifacts corresponding to different malware behavior. Report results.
% - Investigate which parts of the CapeV2 log are important to different malware behavior. 

% - Expert view
%   - Ask Thorsten to try to explain some patterns and domain specific subjects 


%   What we used - specific method (follow explanation theory) - we are choosing only samples where the model is above some confidence and explanation is per sample, we have several explanations to see some trend; we did follow results in Pevny's work, we did not experiment with different kinds of explainers
  

% (This chapter should have simmilar structure as models before)

%   Previous connection
% - We are trying to explain previously trained models
% Way through this chapter
% - describe steps
% - discuss results
% Next connection
% - Next will be conclusions and final statements, we can summarize results of explanation with respect to different models
