\chapter{Explaining model}
Finally, we present specific method for hierarchical model explanation. One of goals of this thesis is to identify artifacts corresponding to different malware behavior. By artifacts we mean whatever what is among features of our model. Results are based on two things. Firstly we build on statistical method for model explanation (reference chapter). Secondly we are drawing conslusions after presenting those results to expert and then having discussion.

Motivation about mention Thorsten's advice to look at implementation of python signatures and reason why we want to look at it, about the main question - are we able to learn more than the sandbox is doing deterministically so far?
discussion, why we are doing that - I think we can somehow see, what the original signature should care about - what else is significant from the behavior log, but we can see in general other malicious patterns - regardless original signature goal, obviously we see something else which is common

(This chapter should have simmilar structure as models before)

Used technologies
  - previous
  - ExplainMill
  (reference all the repositories - even cuckoo comminity)

What we used - specific method (follow explanation theory) - we are choosing only samples where the model is above some confidence and explanation is per sample, we have several explanations to see some trend; we did follow results in Pevny's work, we did not experiment with different kinds of explainers

take signature groups and compare their code to explanation, from each signature type (rest get to the Appendix)
report explanation and even some information from logs!!
- Time to explain, Explanation size for different types of signatures, input size (Pevny is addressing those)

discuss particular results and try to connect it to models (results have to be real, it is not problem to report that result is not easily interpretable and in practise we would have to create way of extracting general knowledge from sample explanations)
Compare the results to Pevny's Explaner results


hopefully discussion on if the parts contains something significant according to type of signature and so on, or we can find something else than only the deterministic base which the signatue implementation is checking
Do not be black and white, try to formulate hypothesis which should be derived, do not state truth
Connect to motivation part of this chapter

Previous connection
- We are trying to explain previously trained models
Way through this chapter
- describe steps
- discuss results
Next connection
- Next will be conclusions and final statements, we can summarize results of explanation with respect to different models


- Goal 
- identify the artifacts corresponding to different malware behavior. Report results.
- Investigate which parts of the CapeV2 log are important to different malware behavior. 

- Expert view
  - Ask Thorsten to try to explain some patterns and domain specific subjects
