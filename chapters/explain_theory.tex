\chapter{Model explaining}

\section{General approaches}
Cite: All models are wrong but some of them are useful (George E.P. Box)
I can add that one of best advices in machine learning I have received from my teacher was to choose the simplest model with best results. But the further we go the more complex models we use. Can we trust them? (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf)
A lot of researches like this https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.03530.pdf leads us to the conclusion that neural nets generalization is generaly against our intuition or expectations. So let us say more about model explanation.

Motivation example - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2901.pdf
definition
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3287560.3287574 - philosophical approach to explanations, good for introduction

\section{Explaining hmill models}
- file:///C:/Users/domia/Downloads/Explainability_ICML2021.pdf
problem
prior
- also mentioned by Pevny in his work - https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/gnnexplainer-neurips19.pdf (it is able to explain graph neural network also so it could be used in tree-structured data like json)
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06216.pdf - adaptation of LIME in graph neural networks (which also can solve our problem theoretically)
