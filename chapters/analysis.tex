\chapter{Malware analysis}
First phase of our work is about running chosen sandbox to capture sigificant number of analysis results for further use. This task could be divided into two subtask - building infrastructure and data collection. Due to the fact that we would like to collect more than $50 000$ samples and usual analysis take $5$ minutes we will need more than one active instance so the distribution is another challenge.
