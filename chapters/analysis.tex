\chapter{Malware analysis} \label{chap:analysis}
A particular goal of this thesis is to create a dataset of dynamic malware analysis samples. In this chapter, we define the basic notions of malware, PE file and malware analysis. We describe \emph{CAPEv2} sandbox and its output. 

\section{Malware}
Malicious code (also called \emph{Malware}) is intended to disrupt a computer, network, or its parts from functioning. The form or format may vary. It could be a JAVA application, Microsoft Office macro or even a PDF file. Malware detection, classification and overall research is part of the \emph{Intrusion detection} \cite{Cole2009}. Attackers use malware to steal data, use target computer (in C2 or DDOS attacks) or even spy on the owner. Malware often gets into the target computer via usual communication channels: email, flash drive, downloaded. \cite{KA2018}. Malware may contain more parts that have a different role, and we call these parts \emph{components}. The software which is not malicious (benign) is often called \emph{cleanware}.

Firstly, let us clarify several terms. \emph{Malware type} denotes a group of malware samples or their components that show the same behaviour. \emph{Malware family} is a collection of malware that has the same code base (uses same code components). An example of such a family might be \emph{Emotet}, a banking trojan family, or CryptoWall, a ransomware family. \emph{Malware variant/strain/version} is malware that belongs to some existing family but includes new parts which were not earlier detected in this family \cite{Cohen2019}.

Based on the specific behaviour, we can distinguish several fundamental types of malware. Each malware sample may have multiple components, and each component may have a different type. The most usual malware types follow (their source is \cite{Cole2009, KA2018, Graham2010, Sikorski2012}).
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item \emph{Worm} is malware capable of copying itself in a variety of ways and spreading on multiple devices.
  \item \emph{Virus} is capable of infecting other executable files by injecting its payload. The user then executes the infected files.
  \item \emph{Trojan} disguises itself as a regular program. After installation, they can steal the data, control the target machine, etc.
  \item \emph{Backdoor} allow the attacker to access the target machine. The attacker can use multiple machines as a botnet controlled by a command and control server.
  \item \emph{Adware} presents unwanted advertisements to a user of the target machine. They are usually downloaded from the internet.
  \item \emph{Information stealer} aims at the user's data. Examples are sniffers, grabbers, spyware, and key loggers.
  \item \emph{Ransomware} locks users out of their computer or encrypts their data. It usually threatens the user by not decrypting it before they pay some money.
  \item \emph{Rootkit} allows a malware presence concealment.
  \item \emph{Dropper} downloads a malicious code or its update from the internet. The dropper itself is often harmless.
  \item \emph{Launcher} is responsible for running malicious code, usually stealthy.
\end{itemize}

According to \cite{AVATLASM39:online}, the most seen types on Windows operating system are \emph{trojans} and \emph{backdoors}.

\section{File formats}
Malware is defined very generally, and it is not limited to a specific file format. We can find various file types --- Portable executable, Portable Document Format, Microsoft office formats, HTML, Archives and many others. According to \cite{AVATLASM39:online} Portable Executable (PE) files are the most seen on Windows machines, and therefore this thesis exclusively focuses on it.

\subsection{Portable Executable}
The portable executable is a file format mainly for executables, object code and data-link libraries (DLLs). It is specific for Windows operation system. For the 32-bit version, we use the format PE32 and for the 64-bit version is PE32+. Microsoft provides its complete description in \cite{PEFormat89:online}. Description of the essential parts follows.

The PE file includes information necessary for Windows operating system (specifically the dynamic linker) to map the file into memory \cite{Gibert2020}. Usual file extensions are \emph{.exe, .dll, .sys}. It consists of two main parts --- \emph{Header} and \emph{Sections} (see \ref{fig:pe}). 

\emph{Header} contains technical details about the executable. The most important parts are:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item DOS header --- presented for backward compatibility with older versions of Windows
  \item PE header --- executable info such as number of sections, file signature
  \item Optional header --- additional info such as the base of data, base of code, address of entry point
  \item Sections table --- definition of the loading process
  \item Import/export address table (\emph{IAT}) --- lookup table (pointers) for imported or exported structures
\end{itemize}

\emph{Sections} contain mainly the data and code of the executable file. The most important parts are:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item Code --- actual program code (\emph{.text})
  \item Imports/exports --- \emph{.idata, .edata}
  \item Data --- static constants (\emph{.data}), variables(\emph{.bss}), other resources (\emph{.rsrc}), debug data (\emph{.rdata})
\end{itemize}

The loading process of a PE file starts by parsing and validity checking of the headers and sections table. The file is mapped into memory according to the information in specific header parts. Additional DLLs are loaded into memory based on \emph{IAT}. Finally, the file is executed at a specified entry point. \footnote{https://github.com/corkami/pics/blob/master/binary/pe101/pe101.png}

\section{Malware analysis}
Malware analysis is a process leading to a deeper understanding of malware features, behaviour, and goals. We can use several techniques to analyze a malware sample, and not all of them require its execution.

Malware analysis is the most relevant if we do not have the source code of the malware binary because its examination would often give us much more information. We see the sample as a black box \cite{Sikorski2012}.

The goal of the security threats research and description is to find a proper response --- prevent or detect future attacks, identify the attacker, etc. Authors of \cite{KA2018} summarize our motives in malware analysis as follows. We want to find malware components, their role, and address their goals. For example, we can identify malware consisting of the dropper part, which checks the running environment and downloading payload from the internet, and from the launcher part, which is responsible for the payload stealth execution. 

Another reason might be to understand the malware's impact. It is hiding each step, and if we do not monitor our system (for example, using integrity checks), we might not realize the threat. We want to observe and report its behaviour in the target computer (file names, registries, etc.). We also need to detect network intrusion, which might be critical for preventing the malware from spreading across a local and global network. 

Finally, we want to classify the threat and investigate who the attackers are and what are their motives.

The analysis might be followed by a response, which often includes an antivirus update --- creating new signatures, updating existing ones, etc. The notion of \emph{signature} refers to an indicator that can detect malicious code on victim machines or even in the network traffic \cite{Sikorski2012}. The signature detection is based on examining the outputs of malware analysis and checking specific parts.

We distinguish two basic types of malware analysis --- \emph{static} and \emph{dynamic}. In the following sections, we address each of these and describe their techniques.

\subsection{Static analysis}
By performing static analysis, we can examine the target file without its execution. Its usage is limited, but it can narrow the scope of our interest \cite{KA2018}. Performing the static analysis is usually easier and faster \cite{Sikorski2012}.

\subsubsection*{Determining file type}
Earlier in this chapter, we listed several file types frequently used by malware. One of the initial steps in static analysis is file type determination. The file type might correlate with the file extension, e.g., \ \emph{.exe, .sys, .docx}, but reliable technique of its determination is file signature examination. This signature is a sequence of bytes that is unique across different file types. File signature might be examined manually in some \emph{hex editor}\footnote{https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/} or automatically using some programming language libraries or tools\footnote{https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/file.1.html} \cite{KA2018}.


\subsubsection*{Fingerprinting, comparison}
Fingerprinting means generating a cryptographic hash value for the examined file, e.g., \ \emph{MD5, SHA1}. This hash should give us a unique file identifier that might be used to retrieve known information about the malware sample from online sources\footnote{https://www.virustotal.com/gui/}, where we can find multi-antivirus scans and other helpful information. On the other hand, we can use a special kind of 'hashes' to identify similar malware samples. Those could be fuzzy hashes, import hashes, or section hashes \cite{KA2018}.

\subsubsection*{String extraction}
Strings are placed in the PE file encoded by \emph{ASCII} or another encoding. Their extraction from the original binary is a valuable tool of static analysis. The strings might include IP addresses, domain names, file names and others. There are specialized tools for this task \footnote{http://split-code.com/strings2.html}. 

However, attackers know all these detection techniques, including string extraction. That leads us to the file \emph{obfuscation}, a technique used by an attacker to secure strings from extraction, which is often done by \emph{packers} using compression or by \emph{cryptors} using encryption. Even such techniques are detectable and vincible using specialized tools.

\subsubsection*{Code analysis}
The techniques listed above are picking specific features, and by connecting them, we might get a valuable summary for an initial hypothesis. 
However, even without the knowledge of the code, we can examine its low-level steps. That is called code analysis, and we can distinguish \emph{static} and \emph{dynamic} code analysis (CA).

In \emph{static} CA we use \emph{disassembler} \footnote{https://binary.ninja/} which translates machine code back to assembly code which might be further analysed. Another option might be \emph{decompilation} which translates machine code into a higher-level programming language such as C or Python \footnote{https://github.com/avast/retdec}.

In \emph{dynamic} CA, we use \emph{debugger} to examine the translated code during the run \cite{KA2018} (this technique is part of dynamic analysis, we mention it here for completeness).

\hfill \break
There are even other techniques, e.g., \ \emph{PE header inspection} where we can see imported and exported libraries and functions \cite{Sikorski2012} or \emph{Yara rules}, which allow researchers to create indication rules based on the textual and binary information of the malware sample \cite{KA2018}.

\subsection{Dynamic analysis}
Dynamic analyses techniques allow us to examine a running malware sample. The isolated environment for malware execution is often called \emph{Sandbox}. Sometimes we call \emph{Sandbox} the application, which allows us to orchestrate the dynamic analysis and all its parts. During the run, we observe the details about the malware behaviour and even the system's reaction. In the following list, we can see different subjects which are often monitored.

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item Processes --- process activity, subprocesses, etc.
  \item File system --- dropped files, removed files, etc.
  \item Registry keys --- read/write operations with Windows registry keys, including read/written data
  \item Network activity monitoring --- outgoing and incoming traffic
  \item API calls --- external library of an operating system which is called by the malware sample, essentially everything what the malware performs should be expressed in the list of API calls
  \item Mutexes --- flags which are usually created by a thread to avoid another thread from writing to a specific resource at the same time, they are also used by malware for interprocess communication, e.g., the indication of the malware presence on the victim machine
\end{itemize}

\emph{Sandbox} realization is precise work. We need to minimize the risk of malware breaking the border of a safe environment. It is usually implemented using a virtual machine, and \emph{air-gapped} networks (isolated networks) \cite{Sikorski2012}. Using virtual machines is better for overall security, but there are some significant pitfalls as well. The crucial drawback is that malware might identify the suspiciously clean and safe environment and shut down itself before any action. The sandbox setup has to be conscientious to imitate the natural environment faithfully. We should also let some intentional traces of everyday usage as mentioned in \cite{CAPESand75:online}. Despite mentioned facts, virtual machine setup is still more frequent than running malware on a physical machine. There is various virtualization software\footnote{https://www.virtualbox.org/, https://www.linux-kvm.org/} that provides virtual machine management tools. Using a sophisticated network setup (bridged network adapters, NAT, VPN), we may provide even a controlled internet connection (or simulation).

Examples of existing solutions for sandbox environment orchestration are:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item CAPEv2 --- https://www.capesandbox.com/ (earlier cuckoo sandbox)
  \item ANY.RUN --- https://app.any.run/
  \item Hybrid analysis --- https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/
  \item Joe Sandbox --- https://www.joesandbox.com/
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Sandbox evasion techniques}
As we mentioned earlier, the creators of malware know how it is examined, and they might utilize evasion techniques to detect the sandbox. Malware might delay its execution to overcome the timeout of most sandboxes (usually up to half an hour). It often checks the unlikely storage size, version, and other information overlooked during the virtual machine setup. It might detect a low number of CPU cores and other environment details before dropping a payload. If the sandbox runs on a device with GUI, malware can try user interaction detection \cite{Evolutio45:online}. A comprehensive description of sandbox evasion techniques can be found in \cite{Afianian2018} and this blog post \cite{Chailytko2019} describes how we can defeat them.

\section{CAPEv2}
An open-source project called \emph{Cuckoo sandbox} was firstly published in 2011. It started as the Google Summer of Code project in 2010 within the Honeynet Project. This project is no more actively developed but in 2019, community developers forked the original project and updated its implementation to be compatible with python 3\footnote{https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2}. This project is called \emph{CAPEv2}, and it is distributed under GPL-3.0 License. There is one publication about original \emph{Cuckoo} sandbox \cite{Oktavianto2013}, which is a partial source of the following description together with documentation of \emph{CAPEv2} \cite{CAPESand75:online}. Other sources are referred to in the text.

\emph{CAPEv2} is used to automatically run malicious files, collect results, and perform further analysis. It has a modular design which allows its integration into a more complex infrastructure. Other developers can customize and extend many of its functions.

It can analyze various file types, which can be uploaded using CLI  or the web interface. We can see the results in the file system or the web application \footnote{public instance https://capesandbox.com/}. A list of file types that can be analyzed using \emph{CAPEv2} can be found in \ref{app:cape}.

\subsection{Architecture}
\emph{CAPE's} architecture is demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:capearchitecture}. It consists of one or more \emph{host} devices. Each \emph{host} might manage multiple \emph{guests} --- virtual machines. 

\emph{Host} is the environment for sandbox application usually running Linux distribution\footnote{recommended https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/}. It allows us to upload a new sample, retrieve results, configure the sandbox, and many other functions.

\emph{Guests} are virtual machines where particular samples usually run under Windows 7 OS. By default, guests are in the isolated virtual network where they can not access each other, only the \emph{host}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/architecture.png}
  \caption{Official image of sandbox architecture \cite{CAPESand75:online}}
  \label{fig:capearchitecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Components}
The sandbox consists internally of several components. They can be seen in figure \ref{fig:capeflow} and their description follows.

\subsubsection*{Scheduler}
This component runs on \emph{host} machine. It checks configured limits and proper setup. It manages machinery modules and starts a new task if there is a pending \emph{guest}. A new task is forwarded to the \emph{analysis manager}.

\subsubsection*{Analysis manager}
\emph{Analysis manager} is responsible for the whole flow of a single task. It starts other modules which are part of the analysis and starts/stops the machine through \emph{machinery modules}.

\subsubsection*{Machinary modules}
These modules are used by sandbox to manage virtual machines --- start, stop, restore. They are initialized during sandbox startup. Recommended  software for virtual machine management in \emph{CAPEv2} is \emph{KVM}.

\subsubsection*{Guest manager}
This component communicates with the \emph{agent}. It uploads the sample, checks the state of the analysis and the machine, shutdowns the machine in case of timeout.

\subsubsection*{Cape agent}
\emph{Agent} is an HTTP server running inside the \emph{guest} machine to report its state and allow sample upload and related actions. It has to start simultaneously with the machine startup (it has to be added to the Windows Startup directory).

\subsubsection*{Analyzer}
It is a platform-dependent software running in \emph{guest} machine that controls the flow in the machine. It is started by \emph{agent} and its configuration is provided per analysis. It runs the sample using a chosen package (specific for each type of uploaded file). If the package is not provided, it might be determined automatically. After running the target sample, \emph{analyzer} injects it with the \emph{cape monitor}.

\subsubsection*{Cape monitor}
A DLL which is injected into the running sample. It logs any captured behaviour using several techniques like hooking functions, following processes, and PE dumping. It also sends results to the \emph{result server}. \emph{Cape monitor} is maintained in separate repository\footnote{https://github.com/kevoreilly/capemon}.

\subsubsection*{Auxiliary modules}
These are additional modules that run before or during the analysis in the \emph{guest} machine. An example of such a module is the network traffic sniffer or the screenshot capture tool.

\subsubsection*{Result server}
It collects the analysis results and stores them. It runs on the \emph{host} machine.

\subsubsection*{Processing modules}
Processing consists of the following parts - raw data processing, signature matching, and reporting. The first part transforms the raw output to a readable/searchable format, performs static analysis, and extracts network streams. There is a structured output at the end. The second part is running particular signatures and collecting their results. Signatures are stored in a special repository\footnote{https://github.com/kevoreilly/community}. Their interface accepts the processed structured data and generates results indicating that the current signature matches (true or false) and related data. Signature results are added to the structured output. The final part of the analysis is reporting. In this part, all results are stored in \emph{JSON} report and also in the database (other reporting modules might be added).

The list of raw data processing modules:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em 
  \item AnalysisInfo --- parses basic information about analysis
  \item BehaviorAnalysis --- parses the raw behavioural logs and performs some initial transformations and interpretations, including the complete processes tracing, behavioural summary and process tree
  \item Debug --- parses errors and analysis.log generated by the analyzer
  \item Dropped --- parses information on the dropped files by the malware and dumped by \emph{CAPE}
  \item Memory --- executes Volatility analysis on a full memory dump
  \item NetworkAnalysis --- parses the PCAP file and extracts some network information, such as DNS traffic, domains, IPs, HTTP requests, IRC and SMTP traffic
  \item ProcMemory ---  performs analysis of process memory dump
  \item StaticAnalysis ---  performs static analysis of PE files
  \item Strings ---  extracts strings from the analyzed binary
\end{itemize}

A Signature might isolate some unique behaviour, identify some malware family or type, and spot significant modifications performed in the system. The signature report consists of an identifier, description, severity, category, and other related information.

\subsection{Analysis flow}
A target file upload might be performed using the CLI utility of \emph{CAPEv2}, using the Web interface, Python API, or REST API.

If a file is uploaded, \emph{CAPEv2} saves it to the database. Multiple options can be configured for each analysis ---  used package, machine to run on, network setup, timeout, priority, and multiple additional options. We can run only network analysis or only static analysis. The \emph{scheduler} keeps track of pending tasks and runs them. The process of execution is managed by \emph{analysis manager}. In case of running a new analysis, \emph{analysis manager} informs the \emph{result server}. When the analysis is running, the \emph{analyzer, monitor}, configuration and the sample file are uploaded to the \emph{guest} using the \emph{agent}. The \emph{agent} starts the \emph{analyzer}, run the sample and injects the \emph{monitor} to that. The \emph{analyzer} and the \emph{monitor} sends results to the \emph{result server}. After the analysis stops or timeout passes, the \emph{analysis manager} stops the machine. The collected analysis results are forwarded to the \emph{processing modules}. Results are stored in the chosen formats and saved to the database \cite{CuckooSa10:online}. The whole flow can be seen in figure \ref{fig:capeflow}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/flow.png}
  \caption{\emph{CAPEv2} components and analysis flow \cite{CuckooSa10:online}}
  \label{fig:capeflow}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Network setup options}
\emph{CAPEv2} provides multiple possibilities for the \emph{guest} network setup which could be configured per analysis. 

In the case of \emph{None} routing, the machine is isolated, and the only connection is the one with the result server. Additionally, there is \emph{Drop} routing when all the traffic is actively dropped (a more aggressive option). 

Other options provide internet connection (in some sense). \emph{Internet} routing is full internet access through a specified interface. We can also forward the traffic through another gateway, i.e. \emph{VPN}, \emph{SOCKS5} proxy\footnote{example tool https://github.com/RicoVZ/socks5man} or \emph{Tor}\footnote{https://www.torproject.org/}. Last option is to use network simulation like \emph{InetSim}\footnote{https://www.inetsim.org/}.

\subsection{Other features}
One of the crucial features of \emph{CAPEv2} is the debugger, so we can also perform non-interactive dynamic code analysis. It allows dynamic anti-evasion bypasses such as the one used by \emph{Guloader, Ursnif} or \emph{Zloader}.

\emph{CAPE} means \emph{Config And Payload Extraction}. The main motivation behind its creation was malware payload extraction, for which it uses techniques like Process injection, Decompression of executable modules in memory or extraction of executable modules. \emph{CAPEv2} automatically creates a process dump for each process that effectively detects the basic packers.

It can detect various malware families such as Emotet, QakBot, Dridex, and many others. It also uses Yara rules.

\subsection{Produced data}
The whole ouput of \emph{CAPEv2} is listed in the table \ref{tab:sandbox-out}.

\subsubsection{Report}
As we stated in the thesis introduction, our goal is to use \emph{behavioural} features and \emph{signatures} from the \emph{JSON} report, which is the most comprehensive report produced by \emph{CAPEv2}. We will use its format as a direct input for our model. Let us define this format \footnote{documentation https://www.json.org/json-en.html} and the content of the report.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the most frequently used lightweight data interchange format. It consists of two essential structures ---  \emph{collections of key-value pairs} (sometimes called \emph{objects}) and \emph{ordered lists}. 

\emph{Object} is an unordered list of \emph{key-value} pairs, curly brackets surround it, pairs are coma-separated, and a colon separates keys from values. \emph{Keys} have to be double-quoted Unicode strings. \emph{Values} might be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, boolean or null. \emph{Lists} are surrounded by square brackets and contain comma-separated values.

Usually, a single \emph{.json} file contains one object, but there are also cases where a list of objects is presented.

The \emph{CAPEv2} report usually has tens of megabytes but sometimes even gigabytes. Complete schema of the report is in \ref{tab:report}. In the thesis attachment, we can see an example of a real report (\ref{app:attach}). In the modelling part, we will concentrate on \emph{signatures} and the \emph{behaviour} parts, its structure is described in \ref{tab:behavioral}.
