\chapter{Malware analysis}
The data which we are performing analysis on are malware analysis results. Specifically those are dynamic analysis of running Portable executable (PE) files in sandbox environment. In this chapter we cover theory of malware analysis and everything related. \todo{add some motivation example or latest results... - known malware attacks..}

Philosophy could be walking around risk management, probability of risk and resulting damage...
Maybe something about truth and its protection in the world of lies and fake news
Confidentiality, integrity and availability


\section{Malware}
Generally types of attacks and just the intro, to settle the malware into wider context
Definition of cleanware and malware
Types, Families

\section{Portable executable files}

\section{Malware analysis}
introduction
\subsection{Dynamic}
\subsection{Static}

\section{Sandboxing}
existing solutions and results...
\section{Produced data}

\section{Challenges}
Data quality, bias, antisandbox detection... where to find samples? (we should definitely mention motivation why we are collecting our own data), public data (this is quite risky to publish in general)

\section{Prior}
works about malware analysis
works that collected data for machine learning purposes
Mandlik, Stiborek, everybody who used cuckoo or other sandbox data





Previous connection
- Nothing before
Way through this chapter
- Malware definition and types
- Malware analysis
- Challenges
- Data - input, output...
- prior
Next connection
- We are interested in modeling the data using modern approaches, we know that the data are often structured somehow and that is what we will solve

- GOALS
  - Run several instances of CapeV2 sandbox and solve their orchestration for this experiment
  - Capture behavior of selected malware samples in CapeV2 sandbox and store results
- Theory part - types, conditions, bias, Malware types, signatures....
- Sandboxing
- Previous experiments
- Our goal in this part
- Data collection for ML purposes in general
