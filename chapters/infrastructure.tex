\chapter{Infrastucture and data collection}
First phase of our work is about running chosen sandbox to capture sigificant number of analysis results for further use. This task could be divided into two subtask - building infrastructure and data collection. Due to the fact that we would like to collect more than $50 000$ samples and usual analysis take $5$ minutes we will need more than one active instance so the distribution is another challenge.



Previous connection
- Follow up analysis chapter and summarize what we did
Way through this chapter
TODO
Next connection
- At the end should be described output of sandbox and at the beggining of next chapter should be stated what we have chosen and why



- Realization of chapter data 
- our infrastructure - distribution, other types of analyses, network infrastructure (marginally, I am not going to use those data, I think, but I performed it and I can write about the risks and so on...)
- used tools
- distrbution
- pipeline
- run
- results
- Conclusions, comming-outs, summary, discussion
