\chapter{Hierarchical Multiple Instance learning}
The goal of this thesis is to use specifically hmill learning to classify malware samples. Using it we want to  build on the prior work in this area. \todo{add references}

In this chapter we describe Hmill framework and use cases where this kind of learning was involved. Then we will address its usage in malware classification and other applications in cyber security field.
