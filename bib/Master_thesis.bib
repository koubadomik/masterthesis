@article{Chandola2009,
abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has become an important topic in the pattern recognition community, and many solutions to this problem have been proposed until now. Despite this fact, there is a lack of comparative studies that shed light into the characteristics and behavior of the different methods. In this work we provide such an analysis focused on the classification task (i.e., leaving out other learning tasks such as regression). In order to perform our study, we implemented fourteen methods grouped into three different families. We analyze the performance of the approaches across a variety of well-known databases, and we also study their behavior in synthetic scenarios in order to highlight their characteristics. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that methods that extract global bag-level information show a clearly superior performance in general. In this sense, the analysis permits us to understand why some types of methods are more successful than others, and it permits us to establish guidelines in the design of new MIL methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Malicious software in form of Internet worms, computer viruses, and Trojan horses poses a major threat to the security of networked systems. The diversity and amount of its variants severely undermine the effectiveness of classical signature-based detection. Yet variants of malware families share typical behavioral patterns reflecting its origin and purpose. We aim to exploit these shared patterns for classification of malware and propose a method for learning and discrimination of malware behavior. Our method proceeds in three stages: (a) behavior of collected malware is monitored in a sandbox environment, (b) based on a corpus of malware labeled by an anti-virus scanner a malware behavior classifier is trained using learning techniques and (c) discriminative features of the behavior models are ranked for explanation of classification decisions. Experiments with different heterogeneous test data collected over several months using honeypots demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially in detecting novel instances of malware families previously not recognized by commercial anti-virus software.},

Extensive analysis of data on the Web can significantly improve the results of malware detection. However malware analysis has to be supported by methods capable of events correlation and cross-layer correlation detection, heterogeneous data classification, etc. Recently, a class of learning methods building on kernels have emerged as a powerful techniques for combining diverse types of data. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used kernel-based method for binary classification. SVM is theoretically well founded and has been already applied to many practical problems. In this paper, we evaluate the results of the application of SVM to threat data analysis to increase the efficiency of malware detection. Our results suggest that SVM is a robust and efficient method that can be successfully used to heterogeneous web datasets classification.},
