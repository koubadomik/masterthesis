@article{Zimmermann1980,
abstract = {Considering the urgency of the need for standards which would allow
constitution of heterogeneous computer networks, iso created a new
subcommittee for 'open systems interconnection' (ISO/TC97/SC16) in
1977. The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture
for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework
for the definition of standard protocols. In july 1979 the specifications
of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the
name of 'osi reference model' to technical committee 97 'data processing'.
This paper presents the model of architecture. Some indications are
also given on the initial set of protocols which will likely be developed
in this osi reference model.},

abstract = {This work addresses classification of unknown binaries executed in sandbox by modeling their interaction with system resources (files, mutexes, registry keys and communication with servers over the network) and error messages provided by the operating system, using vocabulary-based method from the multiple instance learning paradigm. It introduces similarities suitable for individual resource types that combined with an approximative clustering method efficiently group the system resources and define features directly from data. This approach effectively removes randomization often employed by malware authors and projects samples into low-dimensional feature space suitable for common classifiers. An extensive comparison to the state of the art on a large corpus of binaries demonstrates that the proposed solution achieves superior results using only a fraction of training samples. Moreover, it makes use of a source of information different than most of the prior art, which increases the diversity of tools detecting the malware, hence making detection evasion more difficult.},

abstract = {Malicious software in form of Internet worms, computer viruses, and Trojan horses poses a major threat to the security of networked systems. The diversity and amount of its variants severely undermine the effectiveness of classical signature-based detection. Yet variants of malware families share typical behavioral patterns reflecting its origin and purpose. We aim to exploit these shared patterns for classification of malware and propose a method for learning and discrimination of malware behavior. Our method proceeds in three stages: (a) behavior of collected malware is monitored in a sandbox environment, (b) based on a corpus of malware labeled by an anti-virus scanner a malware behavior classifier is trained using learning techniques and (c) discriminative features of the behavior models are ranked for explanation of classification decisions. Experiments with different heterogeneous test data collected over several months using honeypots demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially in detecting novel instances of malware families previously not recognized by commercial anti-virus software.},

@phdthesis{Dong2006,
abstract = {Motivated by various challenging real-world applications, such as drug activity prediction and image retrieval, multi-instance (MI) learning has attracted considerable interest in recent years.  Compared with standard supervised learning, the MI learning task is more difficult as the label information of each training example is incomplete. Many MI algorithms have been proposed. Some of them are specifically designed for MI problems whereas others have been upgraded or adapted from standard single-instance learning algorithms.  Most algorithms have been evaluated on only one or two benchmark datasets, and there is a lack of systematic comparisons of MI learning algorithms.  This thesis presents a comprehensive study of MI learning algorithms that aims to compare their performance and find a suitable way to properly address different MI problems. First, it briefly reviews the history of research on MI learning. Then it discusses five general classes of MI approaches that cover a total of 16 MI algorithms. After that, it presents empirical results for these algorithms that were obtained from 15 datasets which involve five different real-world application domains.  Finally, some conclusions are drawn from these results: (1) applying suitable standard single-instance learners to MI problems can often generate the best result on the datasets that were tested, (2) algorithms exploiting the standard asymmetric MI assumption do not show significant advantages over approaches using the so-called collective assumption, and (3) different MI approaches are suitable for different application domains, and no MI algorithm works best on all MI problems.},

abstract = {Bag-of-features representations have recently become popular for content based image classification owing to their simplicity and good performance. They evolved from texton methods in texture analysis. The basic idea is to treat images as loose collections of independent patches, sampling a representative set of patches from the image, evaluating a visual descriptor vector for each patch independently, and using the resulting distribution of samples in descriptor space as a characterization of the image. The four main implementation choices are thus how to sample patches, how to describe them, how to characterize the resulting distributions and how to classify images based on the result. We concentrate on the first issue, showing experimentally that for a representative selection of commonly used test databases and for moderate to large numbers of samples, random sampling gives equal or better classifiers than the sophisticated multiscale interest operators that are in common use. Although interest operators work well for small numbers of samples, the single most important factor governing performance is the number of patches sampled from the test image and ultimately interest operators can not provide enough patches to compete. We also study the influence of other factors including codebook size and creation method, histogram normalization method and minimum scale for feature extraction.},

Unlike other SVM-based MIL methods, our approach more directly enforces the desired constraint that at least one of the instances in a positive bag is positive. Using both artificial and real-world data, we experimentally demonstrate that our approach achieves greater accuracy than state-of-the-art MIL methods when positive bags are sparse, and performs competitively when they are not. In particular, our approach is the best performing method for image region classification.},

@article{Afghah2018,
abstract = {Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are equipped with many sophisticated sensors and monitoring devices to provide the highest quality of care for critically ill patients. However, these devices might generate false alarms that reduce standard of care and result in desensitization of caregivers to alarms. Therefore, reducing the number of false alarms is of great importance. Many approaches such as signal processing and machine learning, and designing more accurate sensors have been developed for this purpose. However, the significant intrinsic correlation among the extracted features from different sensors has been mostly overlooked. A majority of current data mining techniques fail to capture such correlation among the collected signals from different sensors that limits their alarm recognition capabilities. Here, we propose a novel information-theoretic predictive modeling technique based on the idea of coalition game theory to enhance the accuracy of false alarm detection in ICUs by accounting for the synergistic power of signal attributes in the feature selection stage. This approach brings together techniques from information theory and game theory to account for inter-features mutual information in determining the most correlated predictors with respect to false alarm by calculating Banzhaf power of each feature. The numerical results show that the proposed method can enhance classification accuracy and improve the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve compared to other feature selection techniques, when integrated in classifiers such as Bayes-Net that consider inter-features dependencies.},

abstract = {Modelling network traffic is gaining importance to counter modern security threats of ever increasing sophistication. It is though surprisingly difficult and costly to construct reliable classifiers on top of telemetry data due to the variety and complexity of signals that no human can manage to interpret in full. Obtaining training data with sufficiently large and variable body of labels can thus be seen as a prohibitive problem. The goal of this work is to detect infected computers by observing their HTTP(S) traffic collected from network sensors, which are typically proxy servers or network firewalls, while relying on only minimal human input in the model training phase. We propose a discriminative model that makes decisions based on a computer's all traffic observed during a predefined time window (5 minutes in our case). The model is trained on traffic samples collected over equally-sized time windows for a large number of computers, where the only labels needed are (human) verdicts about the computer as a whole (presumed infected vs. presumed clean). As part of training, the model itself learns discriminative patterns in traffic targeted to individual servers and constructs the final high-level classifier on top of them. We show the classifier to perform with very high precision, and demonstrate that the learned traffic patterns can be interpreted as Indicators of Compromise. We implement the discriminative model as a neural network with special structure reflecting two stacked multi instance problems. The main advantages of the proposed configuration include not only improved accuracy and ability to learn from gross labels, but also automatic learning of server types (together with their detectors) that are typically visited by infected computers.},

Researchers recently pursued dynamic analysis to extract runtime behavior of programs to detect new malware variants. A method is proposed to find similarities of run-time behaviors based on the assumption that binary behaviors affect registers values differently. The idea has been explored in static settings known as VSA, where run-time values were estimated statically. VSA is extended into a dynamic setting in this research where actual run-time values are used to approximate all the possible values. Due to large number of values obtained for each binary in every register at run-time, a small representative set, a.k.a. prototypes, is extracted. Unknown files are classified based on comparison to these prototypes only. Experimental results showed that proposed method outperformed commercial Anti-Virus applications on the dataset used and reached a classification accuracy of 95.9{\%} with 4.5{\%} false positive.

abstract = {Malware is widely used to disrupt computer operation, gain access to users' computer systems or gather sensitive information. Nowadays, malware is a serious threat of the Internet. Extensive analysis of data on the Web can significantly improve the results of malware detection. However malware analysis has to be supported by methods capable of events correlation and cross-layer correlation detection, heterogeneous data classification, etc. Recently, a class of learning methods building on kernels have emerged as a powerful techniques for combining diverse types of data. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used kernel-based method for binary classification. SVM is theoretically well founded and has been already applied to many practical problems. In this paper, we evaluate the results of the application of SVM to threat data analysis to increase the efficiency of malware detection. Our results suggest that SVM is a robust and efficient method that can be successfully used to heterogeneous web datasets classification.},

abstract = {Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has become an important topic in the pattern recognition community, and many solutions to this problem have been proposed until now. Despite this fact, there is a lack of comparative studies that shed light into the characteristics and behavior of the different methods. In this work we provide such an analysis focused on the classification task (i.e., leaving out other learning tasks such as regression). In order to perform our study, we implemented fourteen methods grouped into three different families. We analyze the performance of the approaches across a variety of well-known databases, and we also study their behavior in synthetic scenarios in order to highlight their characteristics. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that methods that extract global bag-level information show a clearly superior performance in general. In this sense, the analysis permits us to understand why some types of methods are more successful than others, and it permits us to establish guidelines in the design of new MIL methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {Many objects in the real world are difficult to describe by means of a single numerical vector of a fixed length, whereas describing them by means of a set of vectors is more natural. Therefore, Multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques have been constantly gaining in importance throughout the last years. MIL formalism assumes that each object (sample) is represented by a set (bag) of feature vectors (instances) of fixed length, where knowledge about objects (e.g., class label) is available on bag level but not necessarily on instance level. Many standard tools including supervised classifiers have been already adapted to MIL setting since the problem got formalized in the late nineties. In this work we propose a neural network (NN) based formalism that intuitively bridges the gap between MIL problem definition and the vast existing knowledge-base of standard models and classifiers. We show that the proposed NN formalism is effectively optimizable by a back-propagation algorithm and can reveal unknown patterns inside bags. Comparison to 14 types of classifiers from the prior art on a set of 20 publicly available benchmark datasets confirms the advantages and accuracy of the proposed solution.},
