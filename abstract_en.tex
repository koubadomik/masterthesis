\section*{Abstract}
Even though machine learning algorithms already play a significant role in data science, many current
methods pose unrealistic assumptions on input data. The application of such methods is difficult due
to incompatible data formats, or heterogeneous, hierarchical or entirely missing data fragments in the
dataset. As a solution, we propose a ver
